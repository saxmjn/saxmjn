## Hi there 👋
Hi, thanks for landing on my page. 

In my present role, I am the founder of [Macha.ai](http://macha.ai/)  a web3 search infrastructure company incubated by Protocol Labs and LongHashX with $200K pre-seed funding. For the past 18 months, I've spearheaded a dedicated team of 15 in the development of a Federated Network and Indexing Solution to interconnect Social Layers across various blockchains and P2P networks. Currently, Macha is in stealth mode, a strategic decision. (For insights into why Macha remains in stealth, feel free to request access to our internal blog.)

I've over 8 years of experience in leading technology and product teams. I have worked at some multi-million dollar companies like UniLend Finance and TapChief (now integrated into Unacademy), where I managed teams of over 10 developers. During my work I have led engineers to build Call Scheduling Infrastructure, WebRTC SaaS, Permisionless Lending Protocol, and Decentralised AMM.

Beyond this, I am also passionately interested in global energy transition and am a fervent advocate for India's critical role in the fourth industrial revolution. In my downtime, I enjoy running, photography, and delving into the intricacies of Indian politics and governance.

I am currently seeking new opportunities, particularly in roles such as Product, or Ecosystem Lead. I am confident that my experience in building Macha can greatly contribute to the growth and success of a burgeoning Web3 company.
